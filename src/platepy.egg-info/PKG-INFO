# platepy Package

Provides

* Methods to easily model structural components for plates via the Gmsh API (see https://gmsh.info/). Including slabs, walls, columns and downstand beams.
* Automatic mesh generation with Gmsh.
* FEM calculation of displacements, rotations, bending moments, shear forces and required bending moment resistance according to SIA262.
* Results visualization with isolines, 3D plots or as text.
* Analytical solutions according to Kirchhoff plate theory.
